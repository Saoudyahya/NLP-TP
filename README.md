# README for Agentic RAG and LangGraphe

## Introduction üåü
Welcome to this practical project (TP) on advanced concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP): **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **LangGraphe**. These techniques blend cutting-edge methods for efficient information retrieval, representation, and response generation, enabling the creation of intelligent conversational agents and knowledge systems.

---

## Objectives üéØ
- Grasp the principles of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and its application in combining retrieval and generation tasks.
- Explore **Agentic RAG**, an enhanced version of RAG with decision-making capabilities.
- Learn **LangGraphe**, a graph-based framework for handling structured and unstructured data in NLP tasks.
- Complete hands-on exercises to reinforce these methodologies creatively.

---

## Tools and Libraries üõ†Ô∏è
This TP uses the following tools and libraries:
- **Python** (3.8 or higher)
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** for neural network implementation
- **Hugging Face LLM** for pre-trained language models
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding sessions

---

## Structure üìÇ
### 1. **Introduction to RAG**
   - Understand the concept of RAG as a combination of retrieval and generation models.
   - Use pre-trained models to perform retrieval-augmented text generation.

### 2. **Agentic RAG**
   - Enhance RAG with decision-making capabilities.
   - Implement agents to guide retrieval and generation based on task-specific constraints.

### 3. **LangGraphe Basics**
   - Represent knowledge as graphs using LangGraphe.
   - Perform graph-based reasoning tasks and integrate outputs with language models.

### 4. **Building a Knowledge System**
   - Combine Agentic RAG and LangGraphe to create an intelligent system.
   - Design a pipeline that retrieves information, represents it as a graph, and generates user-friendly outputs.

---

## Dataset üìä
- Use a publicly available dataset, such as **SQuAD**, **WikiQA**, or a custom dataset relevant to the TP theme.
- Ensure the dataset includes a mix of structured and unstructured data for meaningful experimentation.

---

## Steps to Run the TP üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fssm-nlp/agentic-rag-langgraphe.git
   cd agentic-rag-langgraphe
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. In Jupyter Notebook, click on **File** > **Copy Notebook** to create your personal editable version.

5. Follow the notebook steps in the folder `notebooks/`:
   - `1_introduction_to_rag.ipynb`
   - `2_agentic_rag.ipynb`
   - `3_langgraphe_basics.ipynb`
   - `4_combined_system.ipynb`

---

## Evaluation Criteria üìù
Students will be evaluated based on:
- Completion of all notebook exercises.
- Proper understanding of the theoretical aspects (quiz/test).
- Implementation of a mini-project using Agentic RAG and LangGraphe.
