# README for Agentic RAG and LangGraphe

## Introduction 🌟
Welcome to this practical project (TP) on advanced concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP): **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **LangGraphe**. These techniques blend cutting-edge methods for efficient information retrieval, representation, and response generation, enabling the creation of intelligent conversational agents and knowledge systems.

---

## Objectives 🎯
- Grasp the principles of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and its application in combining retrieval and generation tasks.
- Explore **Agentic RAG**, an enhanced version of RAG with decision-making capabilities.
- Learn **LangGraphe**, a graph-based framework for handling structured and unstructured data in NLP tasks.
- Complete hands-on exercises to reinforce these methodologies creatively.

---

## Tools and Libraries 🛠️
This TP uses the following tools and libraries:
- **Python** (3.8 or higher)
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** for neural network implementation
- **Hugging Face LLM** for pre-trained language models
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding sessions

---

## Structure 📂
### 1. **Introduction to RAG**
   - Understand the concept of RAG as a combination of retrieval and generation models.
   - Use pre-trained models to perform retrieval-augmented text generation.

### 2. **Agentic RAG**
   - Enhance RAG with decision-making capabilities.
   - Implement agents to guide retrieval and generation based on task-specific constraints.

### 3. **LangGraphe Basics**
   - Represent knowledge as graphs using LangGraphe.
   - Perform graph-based reasoning tasks and integrate outputs with language models.

### 4. **Building a Knowledge System**
   - Combine Agentic RAG and LangGraphe to create an intelligent system.
   - Design a pipeline that retrieves information, represents it as a graph, and generates user-friendly outputs.
